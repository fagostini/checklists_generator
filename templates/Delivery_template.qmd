## Data delivery

### Generating reports

- [ ] Log into Miarka
- [ ] Move to the project directory and submit the report job:
```bash
cd <ngi_path>/ANALYSIS/<project_id> && ngi_reports project_summary -p <project_id> -s '<author_name>'
```

This step creates the `reports` directory.

Open the markdown file in the `reports` directory, and check the following:

- [ ] The accreditation specifications are correct
- [ ] The read counts are correct
- [ ] The index sequences are correct
- [ ] All flowcells are listed
- [ ] No deviation note or notification of manual steps should be added
- [ ] No new samples should be added

If any of the above points are not correct, you can edit the markdown file directly, and then run the following command to re-generate the final report:
```bash
make_report [Project_name]_project_summary.md
```

- [ ] Transfer the multiqc report and the `reports` directory to the local machine for later use.

### Standard DDS delivery

- [ ] Check on [Charon](<charon_url>/project/<project_id>) that the _Status_ column is _STALE_ for all samples to be delivered

- [ ] Open a `screen` session
```bash
screen -S <user_signature>_<project_id>
```

- [ ] Run TACA to start the soft-stage delivery:
```bash
taca -c <config_path>/sthlm_taca_fastq_delivery.yml deliver --ignore-analysis-status --stage_only project <project_id>
```

::: {.callout-note}
Remember to change the above command if the project was processed with Sarek (`wgs`) or NGI-RNAseq (`rna`).
:::

- [ ] Check on [Charon](<charon_url>/project/<project_id>) that the _Delivery status_ column is _STAGED_ for all samples

- [ ] Log into DDS
```bash
dds auth login
```

- [ ] Run the following command to start the delivery:
```bash
taca -c <config_path>/sthlm_taca_fastq_delivery.yml deliver --cluster dds project <project_id>
```

- [ ] Write a running note that the delivery has been started

```text
Started the delivery to DDS of project <DDS_project_id>.
```

- [ ] Check on [Charon](<charon_url>/project/<project_id>) that the _Status_ column changed from _STALE_ to *IN_PROGRESS*

- [ ] Release the delivery to the user:
```bash
taca -c <config_path>/sthlm_taca_fastq_delivery.yml deliver --cluster dds release-dds-project --dds_project <project_name> --no-dds-mail <project_id>
```

- [ ] Close the `screen` session
